Event Storming,assess,techniques,TRUE,"<strong>Why are we using this?</strong><br />When organizations move toward microservices, one of the main drivers is the hope for faster time to market. However, this aspiration only tends to be realized when services (and their supporting teams) are cleanly sliced along long-lived business domain boundaries. Otherwise meaningful features will naturally require tight coordination between multiple teams and services, introducing natural friction in competing roadmap prioritization. The solution to this problem is good domain modeling, and event storming has rapidly become one of our favorite methods for rapidly identifying the key concepts in a problem space and aligning a variety of stakeholders in the best way to slice potential solutions.<br /><br /><strong>More information</strong><br /><a href=""https://www.eventstorming.com"">https://www.eventstorming.com</a><br /><a href=""https://techbeacon.com/introduction-event-storming-easy-way-achieve-domain-driven-design"">https://techbeacon.com/introduction-event-storming-easy-way-achieve-domain-driven-design</a>"
Kotlin,assess,languages & frameworks,FALSE,"<strong>Team</strong><br/>Reisinformatie online<br/><br/><strong>Why are we using this?</strong><br/>Kotlin is language for the JVM that allows you to write cleaner code than you could with regular Java because it captures regular coding patterns and makes them easy to implement. It is relatively close in form to java and typescript so it is also pretty easy to adopt.<br/><br/><strong>More information</strong><br/><a href=""https://kotlinlang.org/"">Kotlin website</a>"
Jest,adopt,languages & frameworks,FALSE,"<strong>Team</strong><br/>Reisinformatie online<br/><br/><strong>Why are we using this?</strong><br/>Jest is a unit testing framework for javascript applications. Unlike Karma it is not reliant on external browsers as it uses a browser written purely in javascript itself. Pair this with parallelization and you get super fast tests. The assertion framework is built-in but inherits its syntax from jasmine making for a relatively easy switch from karma + jasmine to Jest.<br/><br/><strong>More information</strong><br/><a href=""https://jestjs.io/"">Jest website</a>"
